BD1 led panel with ws2812b

This is the Kicad project for MrBaddeley's BD1 LED panel. This panel replaces the APA106 LEDs with ws2812B LEDs. For me it is easier to solder these SMD LEDs with tin paste than to solder the legs of the APA106-F5 LEDs.

The idea behind this project was the need for the positioning file to send the PCB to manufacture. The file is not included in the project that we downloaded from MrBaddeley's BD1.

Soon I will upload the "modified" STL of the RearPanel adapted to the ws1812B LEDs.

Feel free to modify this design, adapting it to your needs and preferences.
